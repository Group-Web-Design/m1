<h1>CP1406 - 2017 Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Mountain Hill</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong> Ye Yint Thet Khine, Michael Pai@Moe Lwin, Quang Khai Nguyen, Nhan Gia Huy </p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p> The main goal of this website concentrates on recruiting people and engaging people to participate in our activities such as promoting concerts and workshops, volunteering for administration to have a large community on the web together with advertising the useful services of our website to over the world. For concerts, the other target which our group is looking forward to is to increase ticket sales, especially to the public. Because the social media is very popular nowadays, our group takes this advantage to create the website to let people know more about this site. The last goal of the website is to encourage performers to let us organize a concert for them. Furthermore, our group wants to encourage performers to cooperate with promotion, photo shoots, media releases, etc. that will make the website more and more popular in the world</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Other advertising method have been a success but the most successful one is online advertising (website), our community have help a lot of musicians to have audience and in the process, we make friend with a lot of talented musicians so with this new website we believe that our community is going to increase compare to previous years. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>There is no age limit, we "specialise in diversity" i.e. we provide performance opportunities for a very wide range of styles and genres which would otherwise have little exposure, therefore our target audience includes a wide range of ages and tastes. At the age of 16 and under, busking will need to be accompanied by a parent/guardian. The typical audience may include people with specialised tastes, e.g. classical, jazz, ethnic music, etc. If children are involved, then parents and family members predominate. Every concert, therefore, needs a distinctive theme.</p>
